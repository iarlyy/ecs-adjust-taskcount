# ecs-adjust-taskcount
Given an ECS service/task, this lambda function will adjust the desired count of tasks based on the number of running ECS instances. 

cluster_size * desired_count = new_service_desired_count

Ex: 
cluster_size = 3 (3 ecs instances running)
desired_count = 1 
new_service_desired_count = 3 (1 * cluster_size)

If a scale up/down happen, lambda will increase/decrease of desired count of the service.


It might be useful when you don't have cloudwatch metrics to use as triggers to scale up/down your service or you just want to keep the number tasks(ex: tasks using HOST network) to the same number of running instances.
